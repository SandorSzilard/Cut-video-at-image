# Cut-video-at-image
A Powershell script using ffmpeg to find an image in a video and cut the video at the image (similar to the application "cut at black" but it can be used with any image from the movie => ex. an intro screen in a serial maraton compilation, slitting the compilation in smaller chunks)
